## tl;dr


```
npm install puppeteer && pip3 install playwright && playwright install
pip3 install tensorflowjs
make test && make train
# Training will run indefinitely; it can be interrupted by ^C, and restarted by running `make train` again (weights are autosaved every minute or so)
```

## Dependencies

The repo is self-contained -- it already contains everything needed to run the code.

In order to re-train the model, you will need a few dependencies.
